# gSmart (a chess A.I.)

Can I create a python bot better at chess than I am? 
This repository contains an extensive side project answering that simple question. 

I play chess at a modest 900 elo rating (see my stats here: https://www.chess.com/stats/daily/chess/g_baby21)
My aim is to create an AI that plays at an elo of 1000 or greater.

gSmart is:
- chess.py    ...chess, digitalized! The backend.
- gui.py      ...we ain't playing on the commandline. The frontend.
- img/        ...photos of a handmade Italian chess set given to me by my Grandmother. Used by gui.py.
- engine.py   ...a chess AI
