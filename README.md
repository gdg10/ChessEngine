# gSmart (a chess A.I.)

Can I create a python bot better at chess than I am? 

This repository contains an extensive side project answering that simple question. I call it: gSmart.
I play blitz chess around a 900 elo rating (see my stats here: https://www.chess.com/stats/daily/chess/g_baby21)
My aim is to create the gSmart A.I. such that it plays at an elo of 1000 or greater.

gSmart is:
- chess.py    ...chess, but virtual! The backend
- gui.py      ...The frontend. Created with picture of my chess set (which was given to me by my Grandma)
- img/        ...contains the photos used by gui.py
- engine.py   ...the chess A.I.
- gSmart.py   ...a master wrapper class that brings it all together
